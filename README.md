## 🧑‍💻 Why I’m Building This

Because I got tired of losing hours manually hunting for information in research PDFs.  
Because I believe research should be fast, beautiful, and AI-augmented.  
Because no one else will build it the way I need it.

This isn’t just a project — it’s a return.  
A declaration that I’m back in motion.  
This README was rewritten on the night I chose to rise again.
